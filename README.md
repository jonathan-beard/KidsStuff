# Kids Stuff

This is a collection of basic programming assignments that kids (mine is 7)
can copy from a printed sheet to get the basic concepts down. I'll divide
these up into things that are copyable and those that are actual assignments
for them to work on. I was 6 when I took my first computer class. We coped on
programs from paper to a Mac II. I can't seem to find any of those, but 
maybe we can start a library with some decent programs to get kids interested.

Eventually we'll have multiple languages, but right
now I'm starting with Java since well...segmentation faults kindof put
people off of programming when they have no idea how to debug them.

Feel free to contribute.
